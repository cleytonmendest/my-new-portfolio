Users can now\nswitch languages via a dropdown similar to the theme toggle.\n\nChanges:\n- Removed [locale] route directory\n- Updated i18n/request.ts to detect locale from NEXT_LOCALE cookie\n- Created server actions for locale management (src/actions/locale.ts)\n- Added LanguageSwitcher component with dropdown UI\n- Added ThemeToggle component for dark/light mode\n- Simplified middleware to pass-through requests\n- Updated app layout to use cookie-based locale detection\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
